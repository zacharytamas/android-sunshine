# android-sunshine

In an effort to diversify, I've been taking Udacity's "Developing Android Apps" course. This is the 
project that I'm building in there.

## Lesson milestones

The Udacity course is broken up into multiple lessons per course and I've been tagging the state of my 
code at the end of each lesson. You can find those on this repository's 
[releases page](https://github.com/zacharytamas/android-sunshine/releases).
